The computers are in room 02.05.014
Their status is shown here:
https://adm9.in.tum.de/prakt/02.05.014

Usually the room is open. The door requires a gentle push (not a harsh one). If the room is locked for some reason, someone at the chair (rooms 02.09.*) or the security guard (across the main entrance) should be able to unlock it.

You can also access the computers remotely through SSH on port 58022 with the following hostnames:
atcremers45.informatik.tu-muenchen.de
to
atcremers65.informatik.tu-muenchen.de

Use the command
screen -xR
if you want a persistent virtual session on that computer that remains even if you disconnect, i.e. in which you can train the neural network etc.

Larger GPUs can be made available upon request. Please do not use a larger GPU than needed.

Please make sure to not block/crash each other's computations. Useful commands are: 
Checking who's logged in: finger 
Checking CPU usage: top 
Checking GPU usage: nvidia-smi -l 1 

You can use different computers, your home directory is global.

Temporary data can be stored on the local hard drive: /work/<username>/
(accessible as /remwork/ from other computers).
Improtant data can be stored in
/usr/data/cvpr_shared/
for example:
Most projects from blue slides: /usr/data/cvpr_shared/biology/
Project from grey slide: /usr/data/cvpr_shared/medimg/

Please do not put too much data into your home directory.
